TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

1. Definitions.
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, 
such as semiconductor masks. "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work 
licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". 

2. Source Code.
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

3. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright 
on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. 
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the 
unmodified Program.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, 
in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on 
each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating 
that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 
apply to the code; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with 
the Program.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce 
it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, 
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it.
  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under 
     this License. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this 
     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.
  c) You must remove all "Twirvo" branding, logos, and trademarked names from 
     the modified version unless you have obtained a separate trademark 
     license from Michael Yebba.

6. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, 
effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library 
contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such 
modifications, if you also meet the requirements of section 4.

7. Additional Terms.
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by 
making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions 
that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were 
included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable 
law.

8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a work provided under this License except as 
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or 
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this 
License.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy 
of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a work occurring solely as a 
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does 
not require acceptance.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Users.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a 
license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, 
subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by 
third parties with this License.

11. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse 
you from the conditions of this License.

12. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, 
your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it 
remotely through a computer network an opportunity to receive the 
Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding 
Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary 
means of facilitating copying of software.

13. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the 
GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be 
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address 
new problems or concerns.

14. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE 
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR 
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE 
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. 
SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY 
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

15. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL 
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE 
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE 
OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA 
OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD 
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), 
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SUCH DAMAGES.

16. Interpretation of Sections 14 and 15.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above 
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts 
shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of 
all civil liability in connection with the Program.
